- 👋 Hi, I’m @pjfacia
- 👀 I’m interested in re-invigorating an old interest in coding, creating, solving problems and just flat out being AWESOME!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, first and formost, how to be a great dad; followed closely by ruby on rails and python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing YET; I'm still a nervous little newbie.
- 📫 How to reach me: pjfacia@gmail.com
